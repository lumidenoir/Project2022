### Assignment 2

- The data set is about predicting the car price based on features given(such as height, width, power, etc).
- Using the dataset provided constructed a model using only 6 features.
- split the training and testing dataset in the ratio 80:20.
- Training the model then calculating the accuracy using testing set.
- Then predicting the price of car Ishan wants to buy by the data given below.
    - carlength - 190.9
    - carwidth - 70.3
    - carheight - 54.9
    - enginesize    - 183
    - stroke    - 3.64
    - horsepower - 123
- Added a raw code of all functions and methods in source code.py
- Checked the accuracy of model using library functions of sklearn(only checked the accuracy).
